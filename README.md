# Dan White
Principal Software Engineer with a focus on backend development, DevOps, security, and infrastructure operating in redundant, multi-region HITRUST environments.  Owner and Principal at Blue Tufa LLC.  

## Language and Development Tools
- I am a polyglot but the languages I've been most interested in exploring recently are Rust, Scala 3, Kotlin and Ruby.  
- I also have an interest in Node, Java, Python.  
- Recent platform investigations have led me to prototypes with the (Micronaut Framework)[https://micronaut.io/] as well as practical applications of the SpringBoot framework.  
- Most of my DevOps and infrastructure experience are on the AWS platform with Terraform and CloudFormation, but I also have an interest in investigating Linode.
